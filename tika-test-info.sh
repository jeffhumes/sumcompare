echo "This demonstrates how Tika detects file types based on actual"
echo "content (magic bytes) rather than just file extensions."
echo ""
echo "Example scenarios:"
echo ""
echo "1. Renamed files: A .jpg file renamed to .txt will still be"
echo "   detected as an image"
echo ""
echo "2. Missing extensions: A video file without an extension will"
echo "   still be detected as a video"
echo ""
echo "3. Wrong extensions: An image file with .mp4 extension will"
echo "   still be detected as an image"
echo ""

echo "Benefits of Tika over extension-based detection:"
echo ""
echo "✓ Accurate detection even with wrong/missing extensions"
echo "✓ Detects thousands of file formats (not just video/image)"
echo "✓ Reads file content headers (magic bytes) for identification"
echo "✓ Handles complex formats like Office documents, archives, etc."
echo "✓ Prevents misclassification from renamed files"
